///
/// It requires a related set of Mesh data that it does not refer to:
/// in object construction this Mesh data is likely to be the
/// structures containing vertex information and so on resident on a
/// CPU; in rendering the Mesh data is likely to be graphical objects
/// (such as OpenGL VAOs) that may reside (at least in part) on the
/// GPU.
///
/// The Instantiable data must be kept available to its related Instance.
///
/// The content of the Instantiable includes an array of Skeletons and
/// mesh transformation matrices, with appropriate index values. These
/// index values are into the related set of Mesh data.
